# Tethys Mini-Games

This folder is a sandbox for lightweight, text-first Python games that riff on World of Tethys lore. The goal is to prototype narrative toys you can run in the terminal before investing in full-fledged UI/engines.

## Getting started

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv          # optional, but keeps things tidy
source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt # not needed yet, placeholder for future libs

python games/signal_ping.py
```

## Current prototypes

| Game | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `signal_ping.py` | Guess the origin of a rogue signal before the predator sniffs you out. Simple loop with lore-flavored hints. |

Drop future experiments into this folder (one `.py` file per micro-game) and add them to the table above with a one-line summary + usage tips. Keep dependencies minimal so writers or narrators can run these between recording sessions.*** End Patch***} to=functions.apply_patch ***!
